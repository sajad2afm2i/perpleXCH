?? Height: 2.07 m
?? Fuselage: 10.4 m
?? Number of main parts: 79 pieces

?? Weight and propulsion:

?? Weight without fuel: 1.41 t
? Weight with full tanks: 3.06 t
?? Maximum takeoff weight: 4.2 t (with tanks and additional cargo)

?? Engine and thrust:

?? Proposed engine model: General Electric F404-GE-IN20 (replacement: Klimov RD-93MA)
?? Number of engines: 2

?? Thrust per engine:
• 60–65 kN at 2 km
• 15–17 kN at 15 km

?? Total thrust at low altitude: 125–130 kN
?? Total thrust at high altitude: 30–34 kN

? Fuel consumption:

??  Cruise mode (70% thrust): about 1050 kg/h (per engine)
?? Full thrust: about 1600-1700 kg/h
?? Afterburner: about 2400-2500 kg/h
?? Total fuel consumption in cruise mode (2 engines): about 2100 kg/h

?? Thrust-to-weight ratio:

? At altitude 2 km: ˜ 3.15
? At altitude 15 km: ˜ 0.82

?? Flight and performance:

? Maximum speed: 860 m/s (˜ 3096 km/h)
??? Range at maximum speed: about 1300-1500 km
?? Optimal economic speed: about 1100-1300 km/h
?? Range at economic speed (with 2 additional fuel tanks): about 3700-4200 km ?

?? Logical and practical technologies and capabilities:

?? Tactical AI assistance
• Assisting in the analysis of sensor data to improve decision-making in reconnaissance and surveillance missions
• Support in the detection of common threats, requiring control  Human for final decision-making

?? Semi-autonomous flight
• Automatic routing using GPS and GLONASS
• Automatic return to base in case of communication failure or technical problem
• Optimized fuel consumption on planned routes

?? Moderate reduction in acoustic and thermal signature
• Exhaust designed to reduce engine noise, not completely silent
• Thermal coating with conventional technology to reduce thermal reflection, not completely invisible

??? Encrypted satellite communications
• Use of AES-256 or similar protocol
• Possibility of using public satellite networks with appropriate security

?? Limited weapon delivery system and semi-automatic targeting
• Weapon stations limited to guided bombs and small missiles
• Targeting with the help of radar and optical systems with medium accuracy, operator confirmation required

?? Data protection against common electromagnetic disturbances
• Backup memory resistant to common jamming, not completely resistant to severe EMPs

?? Night vision sensors  and infrared with limited coverage
• Night vision and infrared for typical dark and foggy conditions
• Target detection radius of about 10 km

?? Micro-drone carrier with limited range and capability
• Send and receive data from small micro-drones for short-range reconnaissance missions
• Command relay in a local area, not a wide network

??? Optimized radar signature coverage, not completely stealth
• Relatively reduced radar signature with aerodynamic design and special coatings
• Detectable by advanced radars but with a delay in detection

?? Simple group communication between drones
• Limited coordination between 3 to 5 drones with basic information sharing
• Suitable performance for small but not complex group operations

?? Tactical applications:

• Tactical and strategic reconnaissance
• Long-term patrol missions
• Secret attack on high-value targets
• Escort operations for manned aircraft
• Penetration of radar zones and electronic warfare
• Coordinated support for lighter drones or UGVs
• Border security and  Disaster Monitoring
